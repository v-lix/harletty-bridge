//! One codec family as a bridge: the [`FamilyPipeline`] a family crate
//! implements, and the [`PluginBridge`] that turns it into the
//! [`FormatBridge`] a host loads.
//!
//! What every bridge does whatever it decodes lives here, once: the panic
//! guard around `push_packet`, the reset a codec path asks for
//! ([`AfterPush`]), the raw codec lock (declared through `input_codec`,
//! sniffed, or a fallback for one packet), IEC 61937 burst types the family
//! does not decode, and the `log_level` and `presentation` configuration
//! keys. A family only decodes and describes its stream.
//!
//! Statically dispatched: a plugin is `PluginBridge<OneFamily>`, and nothing
//! on the packet path goes through a vtable but the host's own call.
